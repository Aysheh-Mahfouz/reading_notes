DEBUGGING:




Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction.
The debugger keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls the debugging function.
In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code.
At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values.
After examining values, you can resume the execution of code.
